        "Credit score card is a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank could use this kind of predicted probability to decide whether to issue a credit card to an applicant or not.\n",
        "If the future default rate is high, the bank would refuse to release the credit card to the applicant, otherwise the bank would release the card to the applicant.\n",

When someone buys something with a credit card, that means he/she borrows money from the credit card issuer, and later payment back to the lender with interest.\n",
